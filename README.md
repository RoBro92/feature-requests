# SmartRV Feature requests 

All feature requests are tracked in the GitHub issue tracker of this repository. Please go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/RoBro92/feature-requests/issues) to view all current feature requests.

Creating a feature request here is the best way to coordinate who wants to implement a new integration/feature and tracking progress. Please note there's no guarantee your feature request will be implemented - it all depends on if enough developers are interested in the feature to implement it and if it fits into SmartRVs architecture.

Note: Please use the GitHub upvote feature for showing support for a feature request. Do not post "+1" comments or similar, those will be hidden/removed.
